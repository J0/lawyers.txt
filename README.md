# Lawyers.txt (WIP)

Pre-requisites 



This script helps to generate a list of all dependencies of an organization. It subsequently compiles the dependencies into a `.txt` file which can then be used for compliance purposes.

Very much WIP.


## How to Use

```python3
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

Install [`license_finder`](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder) via `gem install license_finder`
